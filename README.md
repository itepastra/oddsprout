# oddsprout

Oddsprout is a configurable CLI tool and a Python library for generating random JSONs
with no schemas involved. I made it because I needed to generate some JSONs but all
solutions I found online involved generating data based on templates.

See the [documentation] for usage.

## Installation

```sh
pip install oddsprout
